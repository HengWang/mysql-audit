developer named heng wang. It's pleasure for you to contact me king_wangheng@163.com.

You can get the source from github or sourceforge, the address is:
git clone https://github.com/HengWang/mysql-audit.git mysql-audit
or
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-audit/

The audit plugin relies on MySQL Server 5.5 or Percona Server 5.5. When I develop 
the audit plugin, based on the MySQL Server 5.5.20, and test on MySQL Server 5.5.20,
Percona Server 5.5.20, MySQL Server 5.5.15, Percona Server 5.5.15. Because of the 
audit interface changed from MySQL Server 5.5.16, then test on 5.5.15 is needed.

1. Compile the audit plugin
1.1 If you get the audit plugin source from sourceforge, decompress the tar package.
example:  tar -xvzf mysql-audit-2.2.tar.gz
1.2 Move the audit plugin source into the directory "plugin/" of MySQL Server. 
example:  mv mysql-audit/ ${MYSQL_SOURCE_HOME}/plugin
1.3 Compile and install the MySQL Server in usual.

2. Change the granularity of the audit based on the application.
The location of configure file : ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/plugin/audit.cnf,
default audit nothing. 

3. Start the MySQL Server in usual.

4. Install the audit plugin.
Login the MySQL Server with mysql client, and execute the sql statement:
mysql> install plugin audit soname 'audit.so';

5. Uninstall the audit plugin.
Login the MySQL Server with mysql client, and execute the sql statement:
mysql> uninstall plugin audit;
